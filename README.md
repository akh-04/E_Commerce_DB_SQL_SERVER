**Project Topic**: E-commerce Management System

**Purpose:**
Building an E-commerce business requires an organized database, and with the increasing
competition in the market, it is crucial to have a system that effectively describes business
processes and identifies data requirements. E-commerce businesses can have large data pools
and analytics requirements, so companies spend a lot of time and money structuring and
cleaning data according to their needs. Our project aims to build a powerful and structured
e-commerce database management system to help companies load, extract, and manage
customer and inventory data efficiently and streamline the shopping process to maximize
customer satisfaction.

**Objective:**
1. Prevent duplication of products
2. Current stock market information (product quantities)
3. Increase consumer loyalty by giving discounts or vouchers to regular customers.
4. To extract data and provide comparable, ideal, and less expensive alternative items
5. To identify niches by observing the items and venues that are offered.
6. Keep track of sales and profits and delivery performance.
